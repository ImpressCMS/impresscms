ImpressCMS can be used for many types of web sites. The system is highly scalable and it can be used for example as an intranet for a company with 20,000 employees as well as for building a simple 5-page website for the promotion of your company.
The system is extremely useful for managing online communities because it has the ability to create user groups and assign permissions for managing content to each different group.

For each type of website ImpressCMS offers different functionality with a collection of free modules that are available on [https://www.impresscms.org/modules/downloads/](https://www.impresscms.org/modules/downloads/). A few examples of what you can do with them:
