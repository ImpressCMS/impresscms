ImpressCMS 1.3.12
======================
This is a security release that fixes an SQL Injection vulnerability in the module handler in certain cases, as found by Sebastian Fabry at RIPS Technologies GmbH (https://www.ripstech.com).

Installation
------------
Unzip the contents of the 'htdocs' folder in the root folder of your site, and go in a browser to the address of your site. ImpressCMS will detect that no configuration is present, and will start the installation procedure to help you setup your site on your webserver.

Update
------
When updating from a previous version in the 1.3 series, overwrite your existing installation and update the system module once you are logged in, that will bring you to the latest version.
