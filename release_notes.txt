ImpressCMS 1.4 Alpha 2
======================
ImpressCMS 1.4 is a intermediate release between the legacy 1.3 series and the upcoming 2.0 release. 

Installation
------------
Unzip the contents of the 'htdocs' folder in the root folder of your site, and go in a browser to the address of your site. ImpressCMS will detect that no configuration is present, and will start the installation procedure to help you setup your site on your webserver.

Update
------
When updating from a previous version in the 1.3 series, overwrite your existing installation and update the system module once you are logged in, that should bring you to the latest version.

Known issues
------------
The Protector module is not yet PHP7 compatible, and will not be installed from scratch
When updating an existing site that uses the protector module, you may experience issues because of this. The solution is to remove the protector module prior to starting the update.
