==Checking out ImpressCMS from Git==

Starting with version 2.0, ImpressCMS source code is being developed on Git. You can easily get ImpressCMS from Git. Instructions about this can be found here: http://wiki.impresscms.org/modules/wiki/index.php?page=Install_and_update_using_Git .

https://impresscmsdev.assembla.com/code/impresscms/git/nodes/impresscms_2.0alpha2?type=tag

If you feel like getting the latest "edge" version, you can checkout the ImpressCMS_2.0 branch from :

git://git.assembla.com/impresscms.git

The ImpressCMS trunk is always the latest as-stable-as-possible development code. It is, of course, not to be used on production sites.

==Revealing the blank page backtrace log==

ImpressCMS displays a basic error page when a fatal error preventing it to run is encountered. To help you diagnose the cause of the error, this page contains additional messages that are hidden by default. To reveal them, use your browser "select all" function (for most browsers, you can use "Ctrl+A").

==Modules, themes and languages==

The packages now contains the system module, along with a content module and a profile module. You are invited to browse the ImpressCMS Addons web site at http://addons.impresscms.org to get additional modules, themes and languages you need.

The Protector module is installed by default with a new installation of ImpressCMS for additional protection and logging capabilities to your site.
