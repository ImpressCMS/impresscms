The ImpressCMS Project originally started as a fork from XOOPS 2.0.17.1, from revision 1077 (http://xoops.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/xoops/XoopsCore/trunk/?pathrev=1077). Because of this, many files in the code base comes from The XOOPS Project and were originally copyrighted as such.

Every file that was originally created by The XOOPS Project but then edited by The ImpressCMS Project has seen its header comment block edited, to replace the original XOOPS comment block by a new smaller one. Every single file created by XOOPS but edited by ImpressCMS is and will always display in its comment block, a @copyright and @author tags to mention the file originally came from XOOPS.

An example of such file would be, htdocs/admin.php. Here is the new comment block on header.
