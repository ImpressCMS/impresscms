<h1>ImpressCMS Install Guide</h1>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="2">
<br>
<h2>Welcome</h2>
<br>
This install document is a work in progress:<br><br> 
<div class="indent">* If you see any errors or can improve upon it please do so.<br>
* As always there is a live copy of these docs maintained on the <a href="http://community.impresscms.org/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=Installation+Guide">ImpressCMS website</a>.<br>

* Edit the live documentation online by following this <a href="http://community.impresscms.org/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=Installation+Guide">link</a>.</div>
<br>
If your new to ImpressCMS always download the most stable released version:<br><br> 
<div class="indent">* The ImpressCMS packages are released for <a href="http://www.impresscms.org/">download</a> in the .tar.gz and .zip compression formats.<br>
* You may need to download a (compression utility / file manager) from the internet so you can open the packages.<br>
* Free software suggestion, <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7-Zip File Manager</a>.<br>
* Paid software suggestion, <a href="http://www.winzip.com/prod_down.htm">WinZip</a> comes with a 30 Day free trial.<br>
* Windows Xp and above comes preinstalled with a simple soultion for
zipped files, but its not as powerful as the above software.<br>
* If your personal computer runs any flavor of (nix) there are many utilities already installed to use on your system.<br>
* (If online) Please take the time now to extract all files and folders from the ImpressCMS release you downloaded.</div>
<br>
Lets now take a look inside the ImpressCMS folder you just extracted. There are 4 different directories/folders:<br><br>
1. "docs" - Contains this install.html document as well as the GNU license.txt, changelog.txt and language_changelog.txt<br>
<div class="indent">* All the files inside the docs folder can be very useful to members that wish to contribute to the project.</div>
2. "extras" - Contains a login.php file that may be used to run ImpressCMS in ssl (Secure Sockets Layer).<br> 
<div class="indent">* This feature is mostly used in ecommerce for accepting credit cards on your website.<br>
* You would need to purchase an SSL Certificate from a company like
Verisign or Thawte for this feature to work.<br>
                    * Please take a look at the readme.txt in "extras" folder.</div>
3. "htdocs" - Contains all the fundamental files and folders of the ImpressCMS package.<br>
<div class="indent">* For a fresh install of ImpressCMS you must upload all files and folders "inside" of this "htdocs folder".<br>
* They must be installed/uploaded into a working directory in your
servers path. Example: www.yourdomian.com </div>
4. "upgrade" - Contains all the files needed to upgrade your current install of <a href="http://www.xoops.org/">XOOPS</a> to the newer features of <a href="http://www.impresscms.org/">ImpressCMS</a>.<br>
<div class="indent">* Upload this folder "only" if you intend to upgrade from an older version of "XOOPS or ImpressCMS".</div>
<br>
<h2>The Basics</h2>
<br>
To install ImpressCMS for the first time, you'll need to have the minimum following server software pre-installed:<br><br>
<div class="indent">* HTTP Server (<a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>, IIS, Roxen ect.)<br>
* <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> 4.3.0 (5.1 or higher recommended)<br>
* <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> Database 3.23 (4.1 or higher recommended)</div>
<br>
Before starting the install, be sure to have:<br><br>
<div class="indent">* Created a database for your <a href="http://www.impresscms.org/">ImpressCMS</a> installation <br>
<div class="indent">(Have your hosting company create one if you can't. The install script does provide this capability with the proper privileges).<br></div>
* A user account with the proper database permissions.<br>
* The ability to set the following directories and files world
writeable: cache/, templates_c/ and uploads/ and the file mainfile.php<br>
* Turn cookie and <span class="missingpage">JavaScript</span><a href="http://wiki.impresscms.org/">?</a> support in your browser on.</div>
<br>
<h2>Installing locally</h2>
<br>
If your running a local environment for development or testing, make
sure that you have the previous requirements met. Once this is done,
copy the contents of the HTML directory (from the ImpressCMS
distribution file or SVN) to the root document path of your web
environment. Once the files are copied there, you can start the install
by typing <a href="http://yoursite.com/">http://yoursite.com</a>.  This will start the install process.<br>
<br>
<h2>Installing on a hosted platform</h2>
<br>
If your running in a hosted environment, unpack the ImpressCMS files
locally or on the server if you have telnet or SSH access. Once you
done this, make sure to move or copy all ImpressCMS files from the
htdocs directory to your root web directory (your provider usually
provides this location with directions). Once the files are copied
there, you can start the install by typing <a href="http://yoursite.com/">http://yoursite.com</a>.  This will start the install process.<br>
<br>
<h2>Show/Hide help</h2>
<br>
During the installer, you will be able to display useful help and information about the process, by clicking the button below.<br>
<img src="images/help-button.png"><br>
Advanced users may not require this information, but we strongly recommend its usage for people new to ImpressCMS<br>
The button reveals solutions for many problems you may otherwise have.<br>
<br>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<br>
Once the files are copied there, you can start the install by typing
http://yoursite.com. (http://localhost if you run it on local server).
We are automatically redirected to installation script, which will
begin the install process.<br>
<br>

<br>
<h2>Step 1: Language</h2><br>
In the first step of this installation please choose your language. The default is English. Please Click Next.<br>
<br> 
<br>
***Notes***
If you do not see your own language please translate a lang file for this project.<br>

<br>
<h2>Step 2: Welcome Screen, Databases &amp; Chmod/Writable</h2><br>
Welcome the ImpressCms installer. We need to make sure we have a few things setup before we proceed.<br>
The best way to do this is by using your webhosting control panel. Example include Cpanel, Plesk &amp; H-Sphere <br>
Setting up a mysql database:<br><br> 
<div class="indent">
* Cpanel version which can be accessed thru www.yourdomain.com/cpanel <br>
* Access Php admin thru your hosting control panel.<br>
* Click on the database icon for mysql.<br>
* You will be able to create a database with username and password.<br>
* yourdatabase_yourdatabase.</div>
<br>

<a href="http://www.psoft.net/HSdocumentation/index.html">H-Sphere user manuel</a> <br>
<br>
Chmod/world writable:<br><br>  
<div class="indent">
*The ability to set the following directories/folders and files world writeable:<br>
* cache/ templates_c/ &amp; uploads/  <br>
* mainfile.php<br>
* .</div>

<br>
<h2>Step 3: Checking server configuration</h2><br>
In the third step the script will check the server configuration.<br>
This will show the details of your server, and if they are suitable for your installation.<br> 
If the text is green, then everything is good.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/install004.png"><br>
<br>
<h2>Step 4: Paths and permissions</h2><br>
The next part of the install Wizard is designed to check your file and
directory permissions. If your running in a Windows environment, this
should be a pretty painless step.<br>
I use Linux here and as the above screenshot shows, there are problems
with permissions. In order to meet required permission you have to
change them as Wizard is telling you in a tip box.<br> 
Give CHMOD 777 to mainfile.php, /templates_c, /cache, /uploads And hit Refresh button.<br>
Phisical path and Web locations address will be defined by script
itself. If you want to learn a bit more about them, click Show/hide
help button.<br>
If you did last action properly, you should get a message like on the
screen above. Now, the only thing you have to set up is Trust path. To
get more info about this click the Show/hide help button.<br>
Click help button for more informations This folder should be writable
(CHMOD 777). After we set up the Trust path and script said "Trust path
found", we can move forward to the next step.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/install005.png"><br>
<br>
<h2>Step 5: Database configuration</h2><br>
Let's begin with a database. Server hostname - if your hosting provider
hasn't told you different - is localhost. Simply type it there.<br>
It is time to type the rest of info which I told you to prepare in the
beginning. Table prefix is generated randomly to ensure good protection
against hackers. After all we click Next.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/install006.png"><br>
<br>
<h2>Step 6: Saving configuration</h2><br>
In this step thing which you have given before are saved into file. mainfle? secret file under trust path?<br>
<br>
<img src="images/install007.png"><br>
<br>
<h2>Step 7:Tables creation</h2><br>
First part of this step is telling us that it hasn't found any
ImpressCMS tables and it is ready to create clean tables which will be
structure for whole database<br>
In the second part we can see which tables were created. These tables are empty now but we will fill them soon.<br>
<br>

<br>
<img src="images/install009.png"><br>
<br>
<h2>Step 8: Admin account</h2><br>
Please be careful here and write down or remember your administrative
password. You will need this after the install to continue setting up
your site.<br> 
Once you have completed inputting the correct information, click Next to continue.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/install010.png"><br>
<br>
<h2>Step 9: Inserting initial data</h2><br>
As we can see script is ready to insert first data into our database. There is nothing to do here. Next.<br>
In the second part of this step Wizard is inserting default ImpressCMS
values in to previously created tables. These values let ImpressCMS the
essential working.<br>
