# ImpressCMS 1.5.0 (2.0.0)

ImpressCMS 1.5 realizes the majority of the original scope of the 2.0 release, started 10 years ago. It will be renamed 2.0.0. The focus is on providing compatibility with newer version of PHP (PHP7.x and PHP 8.x) and code cleanup. Existing modules that are compatible with the newer PHP versions should still work. This version, ImpressCMS 1.5.0/2.0.0, does require PHP versions 7.4 and above, and contains several corrections and security improvements compared to the previous release.

## Installation

Unzip the contents of the 'htdocs' folder in the root folder of your site, and go in a browser to the address of your site. ImpressCMS will detect that no configuration is present, and will start the installation procedure to help you setup your site on your webserver.

## Update

When updating from a previous version in the 1.3 series, or from a previous 1.4 release, overwrite your existing installation and update the system module once you are logged in, that should bring you to the latest version.
When upgrading your PHP, please verify that the modules you use are compatible!
