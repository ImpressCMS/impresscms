# ImpressCMS 1.4.1 Beta

ImpressCMS 1.4 is a intermediate release between the legacy 1.3 series and the upcoming 2.0 release. The focus is on providing compatibility with PHP 7 and code cleanup. Existing modules that are compatible with PHP 7 should still work, as long as they are compatible with PHP7 and the obligatory PDO database driver that switching to PHP7 brings with it.

## Installation

Unzip the contents of the 'htdocs' folder in the root folder of your site, and go in a browser to the address of your site. ImpressCMS will detect that no configuration is present, and will start the installation procedure to help you setup your site on your webserver.

## Update

When updating from a previous version in the 1.3 series, overwrite your existing installation and update the system module once you are logged in, that should bring you to the latest version.

## Known issues

None so far. If you encounter any problems, please log a ticket at https://github.com/ImpressCMS/impresscms/issues/new/choose
